# Real-Time-Bus-Trcker-Project
# Description of the project:
Using Mapbox documentation to navigate from MIT campus to Harvard campus by animated markers.
The original code of this project uses the setTimeOut() Method while I use the setInterval() Method instead. 
# Usage
Click "show stops between MIT and Harvard" tap after the map completely downloaded. The blue marker at MIT campus will navigate to each bus stop every 10000 ms to Harvard campus.
# Roadmap of future inprovements:
showing realtime where the bus is and headed to.
